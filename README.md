# MERN Stack: Express + Mongo + React + NodeJS and build with Docker Compose

A project that provide ability to build shrinked links. Also implemented authorization(login and register users in Mongo);


## Development

#### Start local development

1) Run mongo docker container
```
docker run --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 -d mongo
```
2) Run server and React App concurrently
```
cd server
npm run dev
```
4) Open http://localhost:3001

#### Start local developmentwit Docker compose

For development, the `server/` and `client/` directories have their own docker containers, which are configured via the `docker-compose.yml` file.

The local directories are mounted into the containers, so changes will reflect immediately. However, changes to package.json will likely need to a rebuild.
(in windows present issue with notify Docker contianers about changes, need use https://github.com/merofeev/docker-windows-volume-watcher)

1) Run commands to build and up docker containers
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
2) Open http://localhost:3002

3) Stop Docker containers
```
docker-compose down
```

## Production

For production, this uses the Dockerfile at the root of the repo. It creates a static build of the client React app and runs Express inside server, which handles both the API and serving of React files.

As a result, different code is executing to serve the React files, but all of the API calls should remain the same. The difference between development and production isnâ€™t ideal, but it does offer the simplicity of having the entire app run in one server on one machine.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```
